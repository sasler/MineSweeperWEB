## 🎮 How to Play

- **Left-click** - Reveal a cell
- **Right-click** - Place/remove a flag
- **Goal** - Reveal all cells that don't contain mines without triggering any explosions!

### Rules

1. Numbers indicate how many mines are adjacent to that cell (including diagonals)
2. Use flags to mark cells you suspect contain mines
3. The game is won when all non-mine cells are revealed
4. Clicking on a mine ends the game

## ✨ Features
